/**
 * <p>
 * Uploads a new object to the specified Qcloud COS bucket. The PutObjectRequest
 * optionally uploads object metadata and applies a canned access control policy
 * to the new object.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Qcloud COS never stores partial objects; if during this call an exception
 * wasn't thrown, the entire object was stored.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Depending on whether a file or input stream is being uploaded, this request
 * has slightly different behavior.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When uploading a file:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * The client automatically computes a checksum of the file. Qcloud COS uses
 * checksums to validate the data in each file.</li>
 * <li>
 * Using the file extension, Qcloud COS attempts to determine the correct content
 * type and content disposition to use for the object.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * When uploading directly from an input stream, content length <b>must</b> be
 * specified before data can be uploaded to Qcloud COS. If not provided, the
 * library will <b>have to</b> buffer the contents of the input stream in order
 * to calculate it. Qcloud COS explicitly requires that the content length be
 * sent in the request headers before any of the data is sent.</li>
 * <p>
 * Qcloud COS is a distributed system. If Qcloud COS receives multiple write
 * requests for the same object nearly simultaneously, all of the objects might
 * be stored. However, only one object will obtain the key.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note: Qcloud COS does not provide object locking; if this is needed, make sure
 * to build it into the application layer.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If the caller specifies a location constraint when creating a bucket, all
 * objects added to the bucket are stored in the same region as the bucket. For
 * example, if specifying a Europe (EU) region constraint for a bucket, all of
 * that bucket's objects are stored in the EU region.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The specified bucket must already exist and the caller must have
 * {@link Permission#Write} permission to the bucket to upload an object.
 * </p>
