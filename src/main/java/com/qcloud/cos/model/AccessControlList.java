/**
 * <p>
 * Represents an Qcloud COS Access Control List (ACL), including the ACL's set of grantees and the
 * permissions assigned to each grantee.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Each bucket and object in Qcloud COS has an ACL that defines its access control policy. When a
 * request is made, Qcloud COS authenticates the request using its standard authentication procedure
 * and then checks the ACL to verify the sender was granted access to the bucket or object. If the
 * sender is approved, the request proceeds. Otherwise, Qcloud COS returns an error.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An ACL contains a list of grants. Each grant consists of one grantee and one permission. ACLs
 * only grant permissions; they do not deny them.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For convenience, some commonly used ACLs are defined in {@link CannedAccessControlList}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note: Bucket and object ACLs are completely independent; an object does not inherit an ACL from
 * its bucket. For example, if you create a bucket and grant write access to another user, you will
 * not be able to access the user's objects unless the user explicitly grants access. This also
 * applies if you grant anonymous write access to a bucket. Only the user "anonymous" will be able
 * to access objects the user created unless permission is explicitly granted to the bucket owner.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Important: Do not grant the anonymous group write access to buckets, as you will have no control
 * over the objects others can store and their associated charges. For more information, see
 * {@link Grantee} and {@link Permissions}.
 * </p>
