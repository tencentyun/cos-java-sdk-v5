 * Cos. Receiving an exception of this type indicates that the caller's request was correctly
 * transmitted to the service, but for some reason, the service was not able to process it, and
 * returned an error response instead.
 * <p>
 * CosServiceException provides callers several pieces of information that can be used to obtain
 * more information about the error and why it occurred. In particular, the errorType field can be
 * used to determine if the caller's request was invalid, or the service encountered an error on the
 * server side while processing it.

     * For example, if a client is using an invalid COS access key, the returned exception will
     * indicate that there is an error in the request the caller is sending. Retrying that same
     * request will *not* result in a successful response. The Client ErrorType indicates that there
     * is a problem in the request the user is sending (ex: incorrect access keys, invalid parameter
     * value, missing parameter, etc.), and that the caller must take some action to correct the
     * request before it should be resent. Client errors are typically associated an HTTP error code
     * in the 4xx range.
     *
     * <p>
     * The Service ErrorType indicates that although the request the caller sent was valid, the
     * service was unable to fulfill the request because of problems on the service's side. These
     * types of errors can be retried by the caller since the caller's request was valid and the
     * problem occurred while processing the request on the service side. Service errors will be
     * accompanied by an HTTP error code in the 5xx range.
     *
     * <p>
     * Finally, if there isn't enough information to determine who's fault the error response is, an
     * Unknown ErrorType will be set.
